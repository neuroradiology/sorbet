# This tests that we don't regress in LSP / incremental resolve mode.
#
# In incremental resolve mode, even if a class has only one call to
# mixes_in_class_methods, Sorbet sees it twice (once from the first pass, once
# from the second, incrementalResolve, pass).
#
# If the second one we see is the same as the one we saw previously, this is
# actually fine. But if the class is different, that's an error.
