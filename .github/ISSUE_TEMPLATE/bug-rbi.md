<!--

Thanks for reporting inaccurate type definitions in Sorbet!

The Sorbet team is usually too busy to respond to requests to fix individual
bugs in these type annotations for the Ruby standard library.

https://sorbet.org/docs/faq#it-looks-like-sorbet-s-types-for-the-stdlib-are-wrong

Feel free to open an issue! But the issue will likely get fixed faster if you
change the RBI files yourself.
