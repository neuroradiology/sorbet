# gems/sorbet/

This folder contains the source for the `'sorbet'` gem. This gem serves two
purposes:

- It depends on `'sorbet-static'`, which includes the release executable of the
  Sorbet static type checker. Thus adding `'sorbet'` to a Gemfile fetches a
  pre-built version of Sorbet behind the scenes.

- It contains the `srb` executable. This is a wrapper script that we use for:

  - initializing a Sorbet project / generating RBI files
  - finding & running the Sorbet executable in `'sorbet-static'` to type check a
    project

This README is for contributors. Here are some docs for how to use this gem:

- <https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi>


## Project structure

A quick overview of the project structure:

```
.
├── bin/
│   ├── srb              → The main CLI entry point (Bash)
│   └── srb-rbi          → The main Ruby entrypoint (called by `srb`)
├── lib/                 → Supporting files for `srb-rbi`
│   └── ···
├── test/
│   ├── ···
│   └── snapshot/        → Snapshot tests for `srb init`
│       ├── partial/
│       └── total/
├── Gemfile
└── sorbet.gemspec
```

- The main entry point is `bin/srb`. It's written in Bash in an attempt to avoid
  the performance cost of forking a Ruby process just to type check.

  (Forking a Ruby process = ~200ms; Sorbet can frequently type check an entire
  project in as much time.)

- When generating RBI files (i.e., not type checking a project), `bin/srb` calls
  into `bin/srb-rbi`, which as a number of subcommands. This is where all the
  actual RBI generation logic is.


## Environment variables

There are a number of environment variables that `srb` reads from to change it's
behavior:

- `SRB_SORBET_EXE`

  Overrides the `sorbet` executable used by all calls to `srb tc`.
  (The default is to find and use the version inside the `'sorbet-static'` gem.)

- `XDG_CACHE_HOME`

  The `srb` command keeps a cache of `sorbet-typed` on disk. Setting
  `XDG_CACHE_HOME` will change the folder where the `sorbet-typed` cache will
  be. (The default when this is unset is to use `$HOME/.cache/`.)

- `SRB_SORBET_TYPED_REVISION`

  Pin the sorbet-typed cache to a specific revision. (The default is to fetch
  and use the latest `master` commit.)

- `SRB_SKIP_GEM_RBIS`

  Disables the loading of
  [RBI files exported from gems](https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi#rbis-within-gems).
  This allows the LSP mode to work properly even when some gems in the Gemfile
  are exporting RBI files.

## Running locally

To run `srb` locally requires first being able to build the `sorbet` executable
itself. See the top-level README.md in this repo.

Once you've built `sorbet`, to run `srb`:

```
❯ SRB_SORBET_EXE=bazel-bin/main/sorbet bin/srb ...
```

To make this easier, you can either

- put `sorbet` on your `PATH` (see the top-level README.md for suggestions), or
- write a test, and use the test harness (see [Running tests](#running-tests)).


## Running tests

To run all the tests:

```
bazel test //gems/sorbet/test/snapshot
```

You'll see the name of each test in the output of the above command. To run that individual test:

```
bazel test //gems/sorbet/test/snapshot:test_<testname>
```

For example:

```
bazel test //gems/sorbet/test/snapshot:test_ruby_2_6/partial/local_rvm_gemset_gem
```

## Writing tests

We use two kinds of tests to test `srb init`: total snapshot tests and partial
snapshot tests. The anatomy of a snapshot test looks like this:

```
test/snapshot/(total|partial)/<testname>/
├── expected/
│   ├── sorbet/
│   │   └── ···
│   ├── err.log
│   └── out.log
├── gems/
│   └── 0.0.0/
│       └── gems/
│           └── my_gem-0.0.0/
│               ├── lib
│               │   └── ···
│               └── my_gem.gemspec
└── src/
    ├── Gemfile
    ├── Gemfile.lock
    ├── test.sh (optional)
    └── ···
```

So a snapshot test consists of a `src/` folder declaring a small Ruby project,
with a `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, zero or more Ruby files as well as optional
`test.sh` script.

By default, the test framework only checks the result of `srb init`.
The `test.sh` script can be used to change that behavior and list the commands
that must be ran in the context of the test.

For example, to test the behavior of `srb init` then `srb tc`, the `test.sh`
script will look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bundle exec "$1" init
bundle exec "$1" tc
```

Where `$1` is the path to `srb` provided by the test framework.

The test framework *always* expects the `test.sh` script to finish without error.
If you want to check the output of a command *expected* to fail, you can use bash
to control what the script should return:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bundle exec "$1" tc || exit 0 # we expect this command to fail
```

The test then also has an `expected` folder, which can be used to snapshot:

- the stdout of running `srb init` or `test.sh` (`out.log`)
- the stderr of running `srb init` or `test.sh` (`err.log`)
- resulting `sorbet/` folder for this project

The difference between a total snapshot test and a partial snapshot test deals
with the `expected/` folder:

- For a total test, all three of the actual `out.log`, actual `err.log`, and
  actual `sorbet/` folder must exactly match (no more, no less) what is in the
  `expected/` folder.

- For a partial test, only the files explicitly mentioned in the `expected/`
  folder must match. The actual output of the test might contain more than is
  snapshotted.

  Note that the entire `expected/` folder is optional for a partial test. Such a
  test will merely assert that the test runs to termination without error.

We **prefer partial tests** because they're more specific and more robust to
changes in implementation details. Use total tests only when you must test the
absence of some behavior.

A test can also have an optional `gems/` folder, which can be used to vendor a
gem into a test. This is useful (for example) to reproduce an issue specific to
gems / gem loading without having to pull in say "all of Rails" or some other
large gem. See the `test/snapshot/partial/local_gem/` for an example of the structure
of a test using the `gems/` folder.

### Updating tests

When it **is** necessary to update a snapshot test:

```
bazel test //gems/sorbet/test/snapshot:update_<testname>
```

For example:

```
bazel test //gems/sorbet/test/snapshot:update_ruby_2_6/partial/local_rvm_gemset_gem
```

### Creating new partial tests

A total test can never be empty, so to record a new total test, just use
`update`, like above.

Since a partial test is allowed to have an empty `expected/` folder, there's no
difference between "a new partial test" and "an existing partial test that just
asserts no errors". As such, you'll have to manually populate the `expected/`
with the files you want checked.
